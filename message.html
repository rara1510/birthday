                <strong> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
                     <br> I hope youre having a good day and all. On your day i just wanted to explain how much you mean to me and how much I'm grateful to have you in my life as my bestfriend. you bring light to my day whenever i see your notification pop up. I'm so thankful for you every thing you say or do helps in easing me. Youre always there for me listening to my yap and supporting me on every step I take. 
                    To this day imagine if we didnt open discord at the same time and I wasnt awake at 1 in the morning, we probably wouldnt have met or gotten closer like we are now (someoneplay fate from enhypen rn). Everything that had happened brought me to you. Whenever i talk to you it feels asthough youre my platonic soulmate. You bring me joy even in the darkest times and you always know what to say or do. Our lives theyre so similar yet different it amazes me. I'm so thanful the stars aligned for us to meet. It's always a 
                    relief talking to you knowing that you'll never judge me or belittle me. You're my comfort and safe space, I pray for you to stay with me always. And soon trust inshallah we'll meet and I yearn for that day. I sound like a love-sick partner right now but you mean so much to me and youre everything I ever wanted in a friend. I'm so proud and grateful to call you my bestfriend. just so yk your names on my lips, when I have nothing else to talk about I bring you up and my irls are probably fed up hearing about you
                    and i hope that doesnt change because you've become a constant in my life I dont think I can throw it all away easily ever. You're so important to me I cant imagine a life without you in it.
                    <br>
                    I love you sm lovie, my kitkat.
